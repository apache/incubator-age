# In the beginning...

Hi there, I'm kw-seo in the Bitnine Seoul. We're first seen, right? nice to meet you. Anyway, I just made some AGE's APIs to test some graph transactions. I also know this isn't the final version and not going to throw this away. So, feel easy to talk to me anything.

# AGE APIs Guidance

#### As we know, AGE is under development and may change to some other functional appearance.

Which means, this program also needs some upgrade as AGE does.

#### Maybe those functions are not sufficient for your needs.

Tell me your opinion or improvement idea. That would be very helpful.

# Using Swagger-UI

We provide AGE's CRUD transaction which consists of input, output. You also check this in Swagger-UI browser. As starting, port 8080 will activate its swagger browser. You can test those functions through swagger-UI. http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/#

#etc

Any requesting about this program would be happy and feel free to contact me. [kwseo@bitnine.net](mailto:kwseo@bitnine.net) or github, whatever you want.
